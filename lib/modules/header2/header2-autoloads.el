(autoload 'make-header "header2" "\
Insert (mode-dependent) header comment at beginning of file.

constructed by calling the functions in `make-header-hook'.  The mode line
and end lines start and terminate block comments.  The body lines continue
the comment.

the strings that cause them to be invoked.
